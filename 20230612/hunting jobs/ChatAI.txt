### How would you make the 10up.com website better as a front end engineer?
As a senior front-end engineer, I would approach improving the 10up.com website in several ways:

User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI) Design: I would evaluate the website's current design and user flow, and suggest improvements to make the site more intuitive and user-friendly. I would aim to create a seamless navigation experience that guides users to the information they are looking for quickly and efficiently.

Accessibility: I would ensure that the website complies with accessibility guidelines to make it accessible for people with disabilities, such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and high contrast mode.

Performance Optimization: I would analyze the website's loading speed and suggest ways to optimize the code, images, and other assets to improve the website's performance and speed. This would result in a better user experience, particularly on mobile devices.

Responsiveness: I would make sure that the website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones.

Interactivity: I would incorporate interactive elements, such as animations, hover effects, and pop-ups, to make the website more engaging and dynamic.

Code Quality: I would review the website's codebase and suggest best practices for maintainability and scalability. This would ensure that the website is well-structured, readable, and can be easily updated in the future.

Overall, my goal would be to create a website that is visually appealing, user-friendly, accessible, fast, and engaging, while maintaining high standards for code quality and maintainability.
