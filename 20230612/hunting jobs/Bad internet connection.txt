We're having communication problems because of a really bad internet connection.
Hey there, Sarah.
Hi Paul, Good to see you. How's it going?
I'm doing great. How's the weather in Ohio. It's probably starting to get a little cold, right?
Sorry, Paul your audio cut outs for a second and I lost you. I didn't catch what you said.
(Your audio is breaking up. I can't hear what you are saying exactly.) 
I said the weather is probably getting a little colder there for four days in Ohio.
Yeah, our connection is bad. I can see you fine but the audio keeps breaking up and it's really laggy.
It might be my Wi-Fi. Let me move to the kitchen the connections stronger there.
Okay, sure.
Okay. Can you hear me know? Is it better? Has it improved?
Yeah, but now there's an echo. Could you try using headphones?
Okay, Let me grab some.
Yep.
Okay I'am back, so where were we?
Hey Paul sorry but now your video is frozen. Our connection is just really bad right now. Let's hang up and I'll call you back.
