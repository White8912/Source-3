## React rule
1. Don't touch DOM.
2. Build websites like lego blocks.
3. Unidirectional data flow.
4. UI, The rest is up to you.
## Things what you must know as a React developer.
How to become a best React developer. I can do.
1. Decide on Components.
Really good developers can decide how much components they have to break down and how they have to build reusable components.
Deciding on how to break down the app into different components is a very important skill.
2. Decide the State and where it lives.
The State can live in different locations in virtual DOM, so decision where we put the state is very important in architecting our app. I mean placing state in appropriate component.
3. What changes when state changes.
I mean unessessary rerendering.
## Asynchronous versus Synchronous
In React, Synchronous action is something that we can expect to happen almost immediately.We wait for that thing to finish before it continues right running the rest of the code afterwards.
Asynchronous action is something that actually takes an indefinite amount of time that JavaScript does not know.
