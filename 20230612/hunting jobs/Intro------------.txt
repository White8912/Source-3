Good morning/afternoon/evening, my name is [Your Name] and it is a pleasure to speak with you today. I am excited to apply for the Front End Developer position at WEX and I believe my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for this role.

With over 10 years of experience in web development, I have a deep understanding of industry-standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In particular, I have more than 8 years of experience with Angular and 10 years of experience with React. I have worked on a variety of projects, from building single-page applications to designing complex user interfaces, and I am confident that my experience would be valuable to your team.

One area of expertise that I am particularly proud of is my ability to build and maintain design systems. I have worked on several projects where I have created reusable components using HTML and CSS, and I have integrated these components into a centralized design system. I am well-versed in version control and can ensure that all components are managed effectively.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a committed team player with excellent communication and collaboration skills. I believe that clear communication is essential to any project's success and am comfortable working with cross-functional teams to achieve common goals. I am also able to navigate ambiguity and find creative solutions to complex problems.

Some of the other skills and experience I bring to this role include an understanding of responsive design, accessibility (WCAG2AA), and implementing UI libraries. I am also familiar with unit testing tools like Jest and Karma and have experience creating custom themes and modifying existing functionality for UI libraries.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have about my skills and experience.


In my previous roles, I have been responsible for building and maintaining design systems, including creating HTML5 Web and Angular components, integrating with the design system, and managing version control. I have also coordinated with development teams to champion the system, advised on available components, and ensured that new components are integrated back into the system. Additionally, I have documented existing and new components, including purpose, usage, variations, and guidelines.

I have worked closely with development teams to receive, implement, and document their custom patterns and components within the design system. I am experienced in managing code repositories, including managing pull requests and releases. I am familiar with how component libraries can be published and consumed by multiple applications, and I understand the importance of strong collaboration and communication skills in order to ensure alignment between teams.

Over time, I am also open to taking on additional responsibilities, such as coordinating presentation layer development and managing Enterprise UX standards and code repositories.
