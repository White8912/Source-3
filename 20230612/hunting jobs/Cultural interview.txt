I have enjoyed working for my employer, they have been very supportive, but I am now ready for a fresh challenge.

+++ What do you consider to be your biggest weakness?

That is tough question.
-----
My biggest weakness is that I don't yet have much experience talking in front of large groups of people. So, I am not very confident at presenting.
However, this is an area I do want to develop, so if there are any opportunities within this role, and within your company to help me develop this skill, then I would certainly be open to that.
-----
We all have weaknesses, and I know my own is the fact I find it really hard to strike a healthy work-life balance.
I love my job as a frontend engineer, and even when I am not at work, I am usually spending time with developing applications, additional skills and qualities so I continue to grow in the role, much to the dissatisfaction of my partner.
This is an area I have been working to improve upon, and I am trying to spend more time relaxing with my family so I can then maintain optimum energy levels when I am at work.

+++ Tell me how you handled a difficult situation.

Situation: I was working at Capgemini when I overheard a colleague talking abruptly to a customer on the telephone. My colleague was clearly stressed from the communication with the customer, and I had concerns that this could lead to a complaint.
I was also concerned that this might not be the first time they had not followed company customer service procudures.
Task: I felt it was my duty to speak to my colleague in private to express my concerns.
This was a difficult situation because my colleague was more senior than me, and I knew they would take any criticism personally.
Action: I considered carefully what I wanted to say and how I was going to say it. 
I spoke to them in private to explain my concerns and how I felt they should have perhaps used an alternative style of communication.
I went on to explain the reason why I felt it was important to offer great customer service, and I also highlighted that they could end up in trouble if a customer complaint came in.
Result: After a few moments discussing the situation, my colleague agreed they needed to change their approach, and they thanked me for my honest feedback.

+++ Why should we hire you?
To demonstrate why you are different from everyone else.

You should hire me for several reasons.
First, I am a very fast leaner. This means I will come into the role, I will learn everything quickly, and I will then contribute to my teams' objectives in the fastest time possible.
Second, I will always take responsibility for my own standards of work. This means you won't have to spend your valuable time closely monitoring or supervising me.
The third reason is, I have a good sense of business acumen. What I mean by this is, I appreciate that your business will only succeed if I represent the company positively, if I am frugal when using company resources, and that I ensure I am always assessing opportunities to help the company increase sales.
Finally, you should hire me because I have a proven track record of achievement, and I will always take positive steps to develop professionally in the position.

+++ How would you deal with a member of your team who disagreed with the work you carried out as a frontend engineer?

I have a lot of experience as a frontend engineer, and I feel the work I produce is to a very high standard. Having said that, I am also aware that when I do work as part of a team, it is important to listen to other people as they may have valid contributions to make.
On that basis, I would certainly be open to listening to why they felt the work I was carrying out could be altered or improved.
**At the end of the day**, we are all working for the same organization, and if it means changing the way I do things for the benefit of the team goal, I will certainly do that.

+++ In your opinion, what are the skills and qualities needed to be a frontend engineer?

Whilst there are numerous skills and qualities needed, there are 9 in particular that are essential to becoming an effective frontend engineer.
In no particular order, these are technical competence, communication and interpersonal skills whilst dealing with clients and internal team members, exceptional organizational and planning capabilities, a level of commercial awareness, and also an understanding of how important it is to maintain competence in my role through professional development.
I also need an ability to expalin technical information in a simple and concise manner so people understand it, and **awarenes** of current isuues impacting the industry I am working in, and also strong analytical and attention to detail skills.

+++ Tell me a time when you worked as part of a team to solve a complex task?

Situation: I was part of a multi-**agency** project building a web application for an important client. Towards the end of the project, we encountered a number of bugs and problems with the web application, and time was against us to get everything fixed before the official handover date.
Task: I felt it was my responsibility to come up with a solution to get the issues fixed. I stayed behind late that evening with two other experienced team members to come up with a plan that would ensure the bugs were not only fully **rectified**, but that a support system was in place to respond to any future issues if they were to arise, post handover. 
Action: We started off by creating a list of all bugs and issues. We then attempted to recreate each bug so that we could assess what was causing the issue.
We managed to recreate all of the bugs and it was then my task to create a **timescale** for rectifying and testing each issue. Once we had a **plan in place**, we could then **allocate** tasks to team members based on their area of technical competence the following morning.
Result: By creating a plan of action, and by working closely together as a team, we were able to tap into the combined team expertise and competence to not only provide a **time-sensitive** solution to the problem, but to also implement a support **mechanism** for our client.

+++ Tell me how you would handle the stress and pressure of being a frontend engineer?

I manage stress in three ways. First and **foremost**, I ensure I plan my work well in advance, so I know what I need to do, and by what deadline. By having a plan in place, it means I work more efficiently and I can decide which tasks need my attention first.
The second way I handle stress and pressue, is to make sure I work closely with other members of the team, and that communications is a constant theme throughout the day.
Finally, I handle stress and pressure by making sure I **dedicate** some time each week to keeping **up-to-date** with developments from within the industry. This gives me the confidence in my role as a frontend engineer, and it also **eliminates** any unwelcome surprises when updates do come out or changes within the industry are released".

+++ How to handle multiple tasks? As a mentor yourself, how do you inspire developers?

As a mentor to some young or non-experience developers, I usually share my own experience with them, hoping to bring them inspiration and help them realize their interests.
I always lead them by examples and mistakes and place great emphasis on thorough testing. And then what is more important is to encourage them to grow and have a strong vision by themselves. I usually demanded that they usually keep developing themselves. And second, the important thing has to have a good appearance as a mentor.
So I tried to keep my positive attitude and engage in honest, open communication, and care about everyone on my team.

+++ How to respond when you disagree with team members?

When I started a project in GE Digital, one of my team members suggested to use a method of coding that I found inefficient. In this situation, I met him individually as we each laid out our plans for the project and the coding method that we found most useful.
After our discussion, we both understood each other's suggestions and presented our ideas to the rest of the team members, which allowed everyone to voice their opinions. We were able to come to a mutal decision as a group.

+++ How can you handle multiple tasks?

When I work in GE Digital, I was working for a important client fixing production issues.
At that time my manager assigned me to develop interface for a new project.
In this situation, I dedicated a day to organize and prioritize which tasks needed attention first, so that I could meet the dealines for both assignments. Having a plan in place, I managed my time efficiently and also delivered assignments ontime.

+++ How do you deal with unexpected changes to deadline?
When I wored at GE Digital, my manager assigned me to increase app performance, in 3 weeks.
However, deadline changed a few days later and I only had two weeks to complete task. While I was a little nervous about my ability to complete the task in time. I asked fellow team members for their advice and learned new strategy that allowed me to increase app performance and exceed my goal in two weeks.

+++ How to adapt new situation or environment?

In this situation, I try to learn a lot as soon as possible. 
If I face new environment, I will ask many questions and take notes about what I learned, reviewing them at the end of each workday. Eventually, I will become familiar with the systmes and I can adapt this environment quickly.
