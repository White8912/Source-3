### Front-end engineer
"I have extensive experience as a lead front-end engineer, including managing a team of developers on several large-scale projects. One project that stands out was for a major e-commerce company. Our goal was to improve the customer experience by optimizing the site's speed and functionality. I took the lead on the project and worked closely with my team to break down the work into smaller, manageable tasks. I also provided regular training sessions to ensure everyone was up-to-date on the latest technologies and best practices.

Thanks to our hard work and collaboration, we were able to achieve the project's goals and exceed our client's expectations. The site's page load times were reduced by over 50%, and customer satisfaction increased by 15%. It was a great accomplishment for the team and a proud moment for me as a leader.

In terms of leadership style, I believe in leading by example and fostering a positive and supportive work environment. I believe in open communication and regularly seek out feedback from my team to ensure everyone feels heard and valued. I also believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and trends, which I regularly share with my team to help them grow as well."
