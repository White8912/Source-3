I have had the opportunity to work on an e-commerce project for a fashion retailer that required extensive use of Vue.js. One of the key requirements of the project was to provide a seamless shopping experience across all devices, from desktop to mobile. To achieve this, I collaborated closely with the design team to develop custom Vue.js components that were optimized for different screen sizes.

For instance, we built a custom dropdown menu that would expand to fill the entire screen on mobile devices, while remaining compact on larger screens. We also developed a product gallery component that would display different images based on the user's device orientation, and automatically adjust the layout of the product details based on screen size.

Another challenge we faced was integrating with third-party APIs for payment processing and order tracking. We used Vue.js to develop custom integrations that would seamlessly connect with these APIs, while providing real-time updates to the user. For example, when a user completed a purchase, they would receive a notification on their device that their order had been processed and was being prepared for shipping.

Overall, my experience with Vue.js on this project allowed me to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly e-commerce solution that met the unique requirements of the fashion retailer. Through my work, I gained valuable insights into how Vue.js can be leveraged to deliver high-quality front-end solutions for e-commerce projects.





I developed a shipping platform at GE with Vue.js for marketing and SEO purposes.
I worked with senior engineers on our project.
There were challenges and I had to hanlde these.
You know, easyship is an all-in-one shipping tool used by over 15000 e-commerce sellers. They came to us with an existing marketing website that needed a complete rewrite to set themselves apart from the competition.
They were looking for developement experts who would help them implement new designs and facilitate their trasition from AngularJS to Vue. 
Because you know AngularJS was way too slow and an SEO nightmare.

The new version of the website was supposed to boost conversion rates and organic traffic.
They needed Vue.js experts who would take up the challenge and complete followings.

First, Building a lightweight Vue.js website according to existing design and guidelines.
Second, Implementing SEO practices for best visibility in search engines.
Finally, Providing the best experience for users to boost conversion rates.

Easyship stayed in touch throughout the whole project by taking part in meetings and collaborating with our engineers directly.

For best performance, I settled on a Nuxt.js + Express-based setup, with MongoDB for translations.

The development pace was super fast, especially at the very beginning, as I already felt confident with the setup from prior experience.

Working on logic-heavy pages, like the rates page or the crowdfunding campaigns page, was the most challenging part.

Core activities at this stage included:

A lot of CSS work with responsiveness as the top priority.
Vue.js development with Nuxt, Express, MongoDB.
Adding support for video and geolocation.
Discussing deployment with our DevOps engineer and the SEO expert on the clientâ€™s side.

Working with sleek, modern designs with lots of animations and SEO challenges, and using our beloved Vue.js in one project was pure pleasure. I was so happy with the final result!
