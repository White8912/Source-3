-------After weekend
This weekend, I had a fun hike at Staten Island Greenbelt, right in our city. I also spent some time learning a new programming library, which I always enjoy. And, of course, I relaxed and spent time with my family. It was a good mix of adventure, learning, and relaxation.

-------Hiking throught the GreenBelt
This past weekend? Oh, it was nothing short of an adventure! I took to the trails of the Staten Island Greenbelt, our own hidden gem right here in the city. Picture this: over 2,800 acres of rolling hills, tranquil ponds, and pathways snaking through a forest so rich with life it's like stepping into another world.
I crossed paths with all kinds of wildlife, from darting chipmunks to majestic white-tailed deer. Even caught a glimpse of a common snapping turtle, our very own state reptile, basking in the sun.
And let's not forget the trees! Oaks, hickories, maples â€“ it was like walking through a living, breathing postcard from nature. Hiking through the Greenbelt, it's easy to forget you're still in the heart of Staten Island. It was a thrilling escape from the everyday hustle and bustle, and I can't wait to hit the trails again soon.

-------Personal interests outside of work
As a Senior Software Engineer, much of my professional life involves complex problem-solving and critical thinking, which I thoroughly enjoy. Outside of work, I seek activities that complement these skills while also providing a change of pace.
For example, I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors. I find that it helps clear my mind, and often, it's during these quiet moments that I find inspiration and new perspectives on the projects I'm working on. In fact, just this past weekend, I hiked through the Staten Island Greenbelt, a vast natural area right here in the city. It was refreshing and invigorating.
I also have a passion for continuing to learn and keep up with the latest trends in technology. I regularly participate in coding challenges and contribute to open-source projects. This not only helps me refine my technical skills but also allows me to engage with the wider tech community.
Finally, I believe in giving back to the community. I volunteer at local coding boot camps and mentor young aspiring software engineers. It's a rewarding experience that allows me to share what I've learned and hopefully inspire the next generation of tech innovators.
In summary, my life outside of work is a balance of physical activity, continuous learning, and community involvement, which I believe contributes to my overall performance and growth as a professional.
