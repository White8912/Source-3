I am a frontend-focused full-stack developer with over 9 years of web development experience.

Since 2015, I have been concentrating on JS frameworks, so I have deep knowledge, especially in ReactJS, NodeJS and VueJS, and a solid understanding of software architecture and experience in working with multiple teams on large-scale technical projects.

I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typescript, PHP, Python, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Docker.
Six years of working in a strong development team gave me the ability to make best practices of technologies and project management.

I have designed and developed UI infrastructure and tooling that empowers developers to build highly performant and scalable services.

I always put great importance on the code quality, Test-driven development, scalability and the performance for the project's success.

Juggling an entire project or working alongside others, I have honed my time management skills for effective planning and organization estimating budgets and completing tasks on deadline every time and made me a team player with good collaboration and creative ideas.

That is all about me.
