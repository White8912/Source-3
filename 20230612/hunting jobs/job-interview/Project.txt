## TBO Project

bluesky410219@gmail.com admin
This project is the ecommerce project that sells mens wear.
The tech stacks are react+javascript+typescript+gatsby+graphql+firbase Gatsby is mainly used for shopping pages as it supports best loading speed and SSR.
This website also has the community area where customers can design and develop their own products as favorites.
At that time we faced one challenge. It is that gatsby did not work well for the very changeable data.
So we came up with hybrid solution of gatsby and react and strapi instead of datoCMS for real time database change and show.
it uses firebase realtime database and notification service. As the project contains so many images in the page,
for optimization we did many things for image loading like lazy loading, caching.
This projects was the first community led ecommerce project. Main services are deployed in GCP and netlify and algoria search for better search performance.
It also has AI and live customer support service. As hybrid app, we used gatsby dynamic routing and
client side routing for community pages for routing. It is also implementing live video sharing system using mediasoup. It is for users only.
And that is based on Google cloud platform.

It has been 7 years since I started working with React.
In those years, I can say I have mastered React and all its relevant techs like Redux, GraphQL, Hook, Context API, redux-saga, thunk, testing librarys like jest, and so on.
I have built many websites with React, Gatsby,node.js and typescript and Next.js.
Some of them are really big projects.
When I do programming, I always attach great importance to good codebase, Test-driven development, and performance optimization.
And I think I am sensible in frontend development to make the perfect website with good design and responsiveness.
When it comes to css, I am good at CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, AntD, etc and styled components in react.
Personally I normally use the CSS frameworks for Grid system and do details css with styled components.
I have worked in several teams and offices so I think I can be the good team member with communication, problem solving skills.
That is all about myself.

## Easybooking project

This is the angular project I have worked on recently. This is fairly big project which lasted around 2 years. The main tech stack were Angular + Yii.
It was a SaaS project to provide tourism and hotel management system to the small to medium size businesses.
There were many challenges in this project and the most difficult one is to analyze the business logic and implement it in the system including finance, tax, pay rules, etc. We came up with solutions for performance and scalability. For example, for fast performance, we used service worker, many caching services, etc.
Also implement the most optimized algorithm to handle the large scale data of the system.

### Advinow Project

https://advinow.com
This is a remote medical service project I have worked in my last position, Advinow.
Through this website, patients can get remote medical service including consulting with doctor and remote devices. We use Angular 11 as frontend and NestJs for backend and also use firebase realtime databases and events to connect remote devices and get real time notifications of status of devices.
AdviNOW Medical (ANM) saves physicians two-thirds of their time by nearly eliminating the data collection and documentation activity of a patient medical visit using the most advanced AI scribe in the industry and eliminating front desk and back office clerical activity. This automation reduces total provider time-per-patient and improves documentation quality leading to better patient outcomes and increased patient satisfaction.
It was fairly big project where 8 developers worked together for more than 1 year for production and one of the challenge was to analyze business logic there.
As api is connected with several other projects and services of Advinow company, it is almost raw data and we need to handle the raw data in frontend in most cases according to the business logic.
Also should do many optimization for the performance.
