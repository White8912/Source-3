Hello LinkedIn community! As a Senior Front End Engineer with X years of experience, I am currently seeking new opportunities to contribute my skills to innovative projects and grow my career. I am passionate about creating user-centric and performant web experiences, and am eager to connect with companies that share this vision.

As a Senior Front End Engineer, my skill set includes a deep understanding of JavaScript and its modern frameworks, such as React and Angular, as well as proficiency with CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less.
