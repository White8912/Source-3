Dear [HR Representative's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to follow up on my scheduled interview with DTEX. Unfortunately, the first interview that was scheduled on [insert date] did not take place as no one from DTEX attended the meeting.

I would like to confirm if the second interview is still scheduled and, if so, kindly provide me with the details such as date, time, and location. I am very excited about the opportunity to join DTEX and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
