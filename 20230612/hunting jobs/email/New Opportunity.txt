Dear ***,

I hope this message finds you well. I came across your profile on LinkedIn and was impressed with your experience in the this industry. I am actively seeking new opportunities and I wanted to reach out to you for any potential openings that might be a fit for my skills and experience.

I have 9 years of experience as a senior front end engineer. I am eager to bring my skills and knowledge to a dynamic and growing company in this industry.
My core skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. I want to work in a fully remote position.

Could you please let me know if there are any current or upcoming opportunities that I might be suitable for? I would be grateful for any advice or guidance you can provide.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
James
