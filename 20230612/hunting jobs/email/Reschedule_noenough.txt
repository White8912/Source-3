Dear Nitika,

I would like to inform you that I may not have provided enough information about myself for our scheduled call today. Therefore, I would like to request a rescheduling of our call to tomorrow at 10:30 am (EST). Please let me know if this arrangement works for you.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Adam
