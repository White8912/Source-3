Dear ***,

Thank you for considering me for the *** role. I appreciate your time and effort in reaching out to me. After reviewing the job description and requirements, I understand that the position requires a hybrid work setup.

However, I wanted to express my preference for a fully remote work arrangement. I believe that I have the necessary skills and experience to excel in a remote setting, and I feel that it would best suit my work style and personal circumstances.

I would still be very interested in this opportunity and would be happy to discuss it further with you to see if there is a way that I could be considered for the role under a fully remote work arrangement.

Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
James
