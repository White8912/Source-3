Dear Christian,

Thank you for reaching out to me about the Senior Backend Engineer role at Allergan Data Labs. The opportunity to work completely remotely and utilize the tech stack of Typescript/Javascript, Node, and GraphQL is quite appealing.

I am very interested in learning more about the role and the responsibilities that it entails. Can you provide more information on the qualifications and requirements for the position, as well as the company culture and team dynamic?

Additionally, I am happy to answer any questions that you may have for me, and I would be grateful for any insights you can provide about the hiring process.

Thank you for considering me for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
