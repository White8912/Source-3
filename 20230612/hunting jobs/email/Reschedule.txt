Hi Recruiting.
I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to express my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused due to my unavailability for the interview scheduled on Today from 12 to 12:30 p.m.

Regrettably, I have a pre-scheduled medical appointment that I cannot reschedule. As a result, I will be unable to attend the interview at the aforementioned time. However, I remain enthusiastic about the position and am keen to explore opportunities to discuss my qualifications with you and your team.

I would be grateful if we could reschedule the interview for a more convenient time. I propose a revised schedule from 12:00 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. tomorrow, if it works for you. Please let me know if this alternative schedule suits your availability or if you would prefer to suggest a different time.

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility regarding this matter. I remain enthusiastic about the position and the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Adam
