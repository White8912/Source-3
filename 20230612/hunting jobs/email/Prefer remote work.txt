Thank you for considering me for this opportunity. I am highly interested in contributing to your team; however, I would like to express my preference for a fully remote work arrangement. I believe this would enable me to deliver my best work while aligning with my current personal and professional circumstances. I hope this aligns with your team's flexibility, and I look forward to potentially exploring this opportunity further with you.
