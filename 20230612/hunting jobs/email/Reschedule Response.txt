Dear Jason,

Thank you for your email and for letting me know about the need to reschedule our interview. I completely understand that things come up unexpectedly and I'm happy to work with you to find a new time that works for both of us.

I am available [list a few dates and times that work for you] for the interview. Please let me know if any of those times work for you. If not, please let me know what times work better and I will do my best to accommodate your schedule.

I appreciate your flexibility and look forward to speaking with you soon.

Best regards,

Adam
