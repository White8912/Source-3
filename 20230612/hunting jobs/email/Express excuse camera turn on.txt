Hello ***,

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to attend the meeting as scheduled due to unforeseen circumstances. During the interview, I was requested to turn on my camera, which I promptly did, but unfortunately, the interviewers did not reciprocate and did not turn on their cameras, rendering it difficult for me to fully engage in the proceedings. As a result, I believe that I have a valid excuse for my absence.
Please let me know what you think.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
James
