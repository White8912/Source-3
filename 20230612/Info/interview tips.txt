Front-end responsibilities
Let me tell you about my role as a Senior Front-End Engineer. My job was all about making sure our web applications looked great and worked seamlessly. To do this, I used a bunch of different front-end technologies - think HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
I worked hand-in-hand with our product managers, designers, and back-end engineers. We were a team, making sure everything we did lined up with our vision for the product and most importantly, met our users' needs.
Now, you can't just build a website and call it a day. Performance is key. So, I was always looking for ways to make our web applications run faster and smoother - that meant faster loading times, fewer network requests, and smaller file sizes.
Being a senior member of the team meant I had a hand in reviewing the work of our other front-end engineers. I made sure everyone was up to speed on the best practices and maintained a high standard of code quality.
And it wasn't just about checking others' work. I was there to help mentor and guide our junior engineers. I shared my knowledge on new tech and helped them grow in their roles.
We followed the agile development process, so I was involved in everything from sprint planning, to daily stand-ups, to retrospectives. It was all about keeping our front-end development on track with our project goals and timelines.
At the end of the day, my main goal was to build web applications that weren't just functional, but were also user-friendly, visually appealing, and efficient. Because that's what our end-users deserved.

Sr. Full stack engineer responsibilities
In my last gig as a Senior Full Stack Engineer, I was really at the heart of the action, managing everything from the frontend to the backend of our web applications. I was in charge of building user interfaces with React, which was super cool, and I also got to work with Node.js to handle all the server-side logic and APIs.
My role didn't stop at just developing though, I was also in the trenches deploying and keeping an eye on our apps on AWS, making sure they were not just up and running, but also scalable, secure and running like a well-oiled machine.
Working with a team was a big part of my job, and it was all about collaboration. I worked hand-in-hand with other devs, designers, and even product managers to make sure we were all on the same page and our apps were ticking all the boxes for our business needs. And when it came to code, I was like the gatekeeper, making sure that any code we produced was up to par in terms of maintainability, scalability, and security.
I also had the chance to play the mentor role, guiding junior engineers on the team and helping them level up their skills. I've always enjoyed sharing what I know with others.
In terms of workflow, we were all about Agile. I was involved in all the key stages - daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, you name it. I worked closely with the Product Owners to make sure our user stories and acceptance criteria were crystal clear. And when it came to project management, tools like JIRA and Trello were my best friends, helping us keep track of our progress and manage any issues that popped up.
Last but not least, I was also responsible for testing and deploying our code changes. I wrote all kinds of tests - unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests - using a variety of tools, and automated the deployment process to make sure we were always delivering top-notch, fully-tested code to production.

Sr. Backend engineer responsiblities
Every day, my work as a Senior Backend Engineer is filled with a variety of tasks that keep me on my toes. I'm the one who's deep in the code, building and maintaining our backend APIs with Express.js. I'm constantly creating and managing PostgreSQL data structures and constructing microservices using AWS. It's also my responsibility to keep an eye on our backend servers, making sure everything's running smoothly.
But it's not just about the nuts and bolts of programming. A big part of what I do involves working side by side with our development team. Together, we design and build the backbone of our systems, ensuring we're creating code that's efficient and reusable, and that meshes well with our UI/UX designs.
One of the really crucial parts of my job is developing and maintaining APIs. This means I need to have a solid understanding of our users and clients, what they need, and how we can deliver that through robust and secure APIs. And of course, I make sure our API documentation is always up-to-date and clear.
Testing is another essential piece of the puzzle. I'm always checking to make sure our backend services are robust and reliable. This means designing and running tests, squashing bugs, and making sure our code and design are up to industry standards.
As a senior member of the team, I also spend a lot of my time collaborating with others. Whether it's front-end developers, designers, or project managers, I'm there, working alongside them, making sure we're all on the same page. And that also means being able to explain technical details in a way that everyone, even non-tech folks, can understand.
So, all in all, my role is really about juggling a lot of different tasks, always learning, and making sure we're delivering the best possible backend services for our users.
